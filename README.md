The dumps are distributed as attachments to
[this repository's releases](https://github.com/FWDekker/fo76-dumps/releases/zOverview).
A new release is created for each update to the game.
The wiki contains a [list of all dumps](https://github.com/FWDekker/fo76-dumps/wiki/List-of-dumps) with a thorough
explanation.

## Development
All dumps are created using a Python script that uses [xEdit](https://tes5edit.github.io/) and
[ba2extract](https://f4se.silverlock.org/).
The main script is located at [`export.py`](https://github.com/FWDekker/fo76-dumps/blob/master/export.py).
The xEdit scripts are in the
[`Edit scripts` directory](https://github.com/FWDekker/fo76-dumps/tree/master/Edit%20scripts).
The wiki describes the [dumping process in more detail](https://github.com/FWDekker/fo76-dumps/wiki/Generating-dumps).
